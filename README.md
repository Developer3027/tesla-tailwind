I enjoyed the course for sure. Learned a lot for a free course. As of Mar. 14, 2022, this is a free course on Udemy. Take the course yourself or play around with this project template.

I enjoyed his walk through of how to get up and running with Tailwind. How to install it and the why and what of the scripts to create and run to compile the css. The images supplied here and the favicon are provided by the course instructor of God Bless You. It was pretty short at just an hour of video and 9 shorts articles. Still, I feel better having taken it.
